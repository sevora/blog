title: "I made a social media application"
---

I made it for my finals on my Computer Science Course as a project for one of the subjects. While it only has the basic functionalities, it works perfectly on a local development environment.

Ofcourse, given the time constraints, I had to limit the scope of this project which you will see in [the repository](https://github.com/sevora/ramble). It is open for improvements, i.e. adding the functionalities and features listed there. But as a quick 2nd-year university project done solo, I believe that it's fine otherwise I wouldn't finish in time.

It is definitely inspired by Twitter. The entire point of the project is to be able to demonstrate the utilization of MySQL database management system in a CRUD-application.

Also, hooray! This is my first update for 2024! This blog or journey is somewhat still alive.

I'd like to write more about interesting things but I don't have as much topics yet.
