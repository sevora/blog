title: "Art, Nature, and Logic: The Path to Creative Coding"
---

## What is this about?
Creative coding is programming mainly done for "expression" rather than "function." It is art of any form
made through code. In simple terms, it programming to create art.

## Where can I find art made through code?
There's a lot of amazing artworks out there made by programming. One particular personality that stands out when it
comes to this topic would be [@beesandbombs](https://twitter.com/beesandbombs). As you will see, oftentimes their work
has patterns that are recursive, repeating, and is inspired from the natural world.

Our natural world is filled with patterns. Patterns that can be described through maths and logic. Maths and logic is a part of programming. 
They're all connected. So, creative coding projects use concepts of the natural world. These concepts are then expressed mathematically
and is virtually replicated.

## Where do I begin?
So if ever this is a thing that you feel you might be into, I would recommend a fun instructor or teacher to learn from.
That, for me, is Daniel Shiffman. He has a YouTube channel called [The Coding Train](https://youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain).

I learned quite a lot by simply following along on some of his videos. Even though creative coding is not my thing, 
I had an amazing time applying concepts drawn from nature through code.
