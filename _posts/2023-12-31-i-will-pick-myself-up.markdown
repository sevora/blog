title: "I'll pick myself up"
---
I lament the fact that I have to be amazing to get what I want. It is tiring. I'm comparing myself to everyone else who could live a life without care or worry to get anything they ever want. *I have to be amazing.* No one would care if I wasn't. No one would bet on me and my dreams. That's why I have to *be amazing.* So I could have a chance to freedom. I keep on thinking back to what I have spent the most time on. I realize that, after being disappointed greatly, I did sacrifice my childhood and my ability to just connect with people. I kept chasing my ideals believing that it would grant me the best outcomes one day. I was a snob, I thought that there was not much point in empathy, and I don't understand how people really think. Eventually, I reached the level of ability I desired and I know I can reach for more. Still, it is daunting to think that we're alone.

Expectations can put pressure on people. But I don't feel that pressure. I know I could fulfill promises and wishes. I just wish that others could do the same without condition. I also want to say, no matter how arrogant it sounds, to bet on me. However, no one could do that. I guess, ultimately, we are self-serving. We could talk about friendship, love, camarederie, teamwork, and family, but all of those are conditional. Nothing is unconditional. Even a pet would only care once you have given it food or granted its desires. Knowing such a thing is difficult.

Sometimes, I wish I was someone else or that someone could take my place. Maybe, I could be reborn as an ungrateful spoiled brat who's given everything. Maybe, I could just be someone who can't dream. These are the unhappy thoughts that come and go in my head. Maybe right at this moment, I just can't see what I have so I don't appreciate it. Maybe, we're always going to only see that the grass is greener on the other side.

But I'm fighting this unhappiness. I still believe in myself.

Why don't we turn everything to rage and inspiration? 

If no one will bet on me, then I'll bet on myself. 

If no one will grant my wishes, then I'll grant them myself. 

If no one would believe in my dreams, then I'll make them come true. 

If no one can give me what I want, then I'll get what I want.

At the end of the day, once I get all this unhappiness out of the way, I'll come back with my neverending grit and I'll win. I'll grant all my wishes, and hopes, and dreams.  I'll pick myself up.
