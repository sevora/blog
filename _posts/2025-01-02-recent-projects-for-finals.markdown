title: "My projects for our 3rd Year Finals at the end of the 1st Semester"
---

## Introduction
Happy new year everyone. Cheers for 2025. This took quite a while to post mainly due to the hectic schedule of our classes and everything that's been going on. Our christmas break was really really short. By January 2 we're expected to attend classes. Sounds insane? It is.

Anyways, near the end of the 1st Semester of our 3rd Year in Computer Science, we were mostly given an assessment in the form of an application or implementation of a system. So here I'm going to quickly show you around the three projects I had to work on.

## Superhealth
You could try it out at [https://superhealth.pages.dev](https://superhealth.pages.dev) and the source code is stored on [Github](https://github.com/sevora/superhealth). It is mainly multiple regression models that are able to classify a variety of things depending on the input you gave it which is information about you.

Its purpose is to be able to give an advice, although not exactly a professional advice, on how to better improve your health. It can try and predict the likelihood of certain conditions. The models are lightweight as well.

## Ramble Mobile
This Ramble project isn't new if you've seen my other entries which is about a social media application. For this one we've provided a mobile client and I extended the server functionality to support the upload of images. It is a step closer to a social media site. The source code is on [Github](https://github.com/sevora/ramble).

## Regex to FA
This is a very specific project and its mainly concerned with automatons. So, it's more of a computer science heavy topic. This mobile and web application can draw the finite automaton diagrams in real-time locally as you input the valid regular expression.
