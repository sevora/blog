title: "Epiphanies of Luck"
---
Right when we're born, isn't our future almost certain? 

Yet from our viewpoint, we say that there's always uncertainty. We don't really agree with the sentiment that everything has been predetermined. Luck always plays a part in this game of life. But, take for example being born dirt poor, you'd need extreme luck to get to a better quality of life. No matter how much hard work a single person does, it cannot compare to the influence of how our own society works. 

No matter how gifted a person is, they can easily be bound by certain factors outside of their control and never reach their true potential. It is luck that severs the path towards the fates they would dream of. It is also luck that bridges their dreams and fates. 

How should anyone deal with luck? It's just a concept. We can be lucky at some things and unlucky at other things. What we must do is to recognize those properly and take the right action whenever luck is on our side. What is uncertain must be grasped firmly towards certainty. That is what those with the strongest desires do.

Why am I talking about this out of nowhere? Maybe I'm just passing time by writing as I've found it to be the only suitable activity given the waiting time. Maybe, I've realized something else. 

I now know how to turn 0s into 1s.
