This is a collection of the stories I have working on tech
and I'd like to start from the beginning.

## Early Days
I started programming when I was 15 years old. That's around 5 years from the creation of this post. Before that, I was 
just a kid being a kid and enjoying pretty much every video game I could get my hands on. I got to experience a wide variety of genres
from different consoles such as the PSP, PS3, and the 3DS. 

Although action games and beat-em-up are fun, I would say that I'm more invested when it comes to the RPG and the strategy side of things.
Later on at one of my classes, I get to see and hear of this intriguing game. *Minecraft.* Of course, what else could it be?

I've began to get easily bored playing as I tend to feel the repetitive game loop that every videogame has. I was searching for a different experience. 
At the time, I was pretty new to the sandbox genre and I was completely fascinated by the concept. You can build anything you want. 
You don't really have to follow anything to progress, you can do whatever you want. *Your imagination is the limit.*

## How Minecraft changed everything
Your goal in the game is what you set it to be. People have done amazing things, even some going as far as replicating the galaxy itself or attempting the
creation of a map that copies the entire Earth including its geography and all of its structures.

What was most striking for me was the existence of [redstone](https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/blog/learn-about-redstone) and *mods.* With those two, one could create a new mechanic or contraption that could very much change
how you go through the game to a significant degree. I would say building structures in the game is akin to painting and drawing, whereas using redstone or making mods
is similar to **inventing**.

## What was my ambition?
Bear with me for a second. This is sort of a tangent. 

When I was younger, I would say that becoming a scientist is my ambition. I really wanted to be one as I was naturally drawn to the process of *invention*.
The creation of something functional, something that fulfills a purpose, something that *works.* I am not into arts and crafts at all, but I am definitely into
machinery, electronics, and figuring out how things do what they do.

## Back to Minecraft
So, with Minecraft I was able to sort of realize that passion of inventing. It was my gateway to the world of programming. I even managed to create my own [Mjolnir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mj%C3%B6lnir)
using [command blocks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/commandblocks) which upon activation would cause lightning to strike blocks away from the player right on to the direction they're facing.

## What next?
On my own, I started expanding my horizons. As I learned more about what one could do in programming, I could feel how liberating it was. Far better than any game,
it was where one could see every concept alive, a place that is inspired and inspires all fields of science out there, it was a place where your imagination and will is 
truly the limit.

That was my beginning.
