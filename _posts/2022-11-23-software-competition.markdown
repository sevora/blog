title: "I participated in a Software Engineering Competition"
---

Back around 2020, I joined a software engineering competition hosted by [AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/product). I just happened
to stumble upon a [video](https://www.youtube.com/@clem) by the CEO, Clement Mihailescu detailing a competition where the winner can win
up to $1,000.

## Why did I join?
For the money.

Yeah, that amount would've been a massive help. Especially at the time, I was still in high school
but I did always want an upgrade on my equipment. Even today I'm using a pretty old laptop with just 
4gb of RAM. If not for my expertise and the fact that I am using linux, this laptop wouldn't be able to 
let me do the things I want such as gamedev.

## Did I win?
Nope. But I reckon I did pretty amazing. I mean, I don't know if the honorable mentions are sorted but I'm pretty
high up [there](https://www.algoexpert.io/swe-project-contests/2020-summer), you would see my project in just a few 
seconds of scrolling.

## What was my project?
Well here's the more interesting details. The theme of the competition was "visualizing algorithms," and pretty much if I'm
going to work on something like that, I might as well work on what I find really interesting.

So, I ended up making a "stable marriage algorithm visualizer" dubbed [stmviz](https://sevora.github.io/stmviz/). I didn't use any
third-party library or framework and implemented everything from scratch. Pure vanilla javascript, and css. I took around 3-5 days to get
everything working and promptly submitted my entry. You could check out the GitHub repository for this [project](https://github.com/sevora/stmviz).

A few days after the deadline, Mr. Mihailescu posted another video announcing the winner. I was pretty excited. However, I didn't win.
Well, it was stil a great learning experience and I did enjoy making the visualizer after all.
