title: "My First IDE"
---

I had a pretty amazing phone back then. It had 4gb of ram and 16gb of storage space. It was where I wrote and ran all of my programs.

## So what is this about?
When learning programming, we learn about text editors and IDEs. That is, the software we would use in writing our programs. My first IDE was from Google Play Store. 
It was extremely lightweight, works offline, and runs javascript (So it's an interpreter). Everyday, I would actually learn something new and then apply it right away
by programming my own solution without ever looking it up on Google. I learned a lot just from that kind of self-discipline.

## Why a phone?
My family's not poor, but we aren't THAT rich as well. We're getting by as long as we do our best. That phone was really not all that amazing.
I would see other kids having way better devices than me. I always thought that their gadgets were pretty much wasted on them. I always thought
that I deserve what they have more than they do. *I was envious.*

## A lesson I learned
Regardless, I've come far. Although it isn't exactly good, envy was a fuel to my *revolution.* What I mean is, it is one of the things that gave me strength and will
to be better, especially on the ones I envied. Anyone could have all the luxury in the world. However, the power one cultivates in practice and virtue is invaluable.

## A lesson I practice
There's also another lesson here and it's something I practice all the time. Despite having undoubtedly a potato phone at the time, 
I was able to learn programming and even get as far as where I am now. 

"To him that will, ways are not wanting" is what George Herbert wrote.
It simply means that, 

**"If there's a will, there's a way."**
